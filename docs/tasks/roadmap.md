3. ~~**Input Validation** → Security prerequisite~~

### Implementation Sequence Dependencies
- **Interfaces** → **Dependency Injection** → **Service Container**
- **Base Service Classes** → **API Coverage Expansion**
- **CI/CD** → **Automated Testing** → **Automated Releases**
- **Error Handling** → **Production Readiness**
